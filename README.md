# learningR
A repository for me to work thru various R books.

- R for Data Science is a bit boring.
- I should learn Geocomp with R, since AP told me to.
- I just came across Intro to Econometrics with R, and maybe I should do that.
- My 3rd year Math of Stats textbook had a bunch of R code, maybe I should learn that.

I have no idea how I can possibly get all of this done in 2 weeks.

So I'll probably have to work on this thru winter semester too. Except I'm also supposed to be doing class work, and RA work, and also I'll be TAing.
